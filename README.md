# ProductionHouse
The production house bankrolls and thus produces a number of movies and television shows. Each television show or a movie will have some staff members assigned to it. The production house consists of a number of working members. The staff member has an option to log in after which he/she shall be taken to another page on which the production data shall be displayed. The production data shall consist of a list of current working titles, titles which have already been produced and all other data such as release dates, cast members, etc. The staff member will thus be given a comprehensive overview of all the data that is being managed by the database system. An unregistered user will be able to view all the released titles and its associated information on the homepage itself.
